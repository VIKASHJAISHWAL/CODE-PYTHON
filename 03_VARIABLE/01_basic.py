# What are Variables?
# Variables are used to store data that can be used and manipulated in a program.
# A variable is created when you assign a value to it using the = operator.
# Example:
name = "Alice" # string
age = 25 # integer
height = 5.6 # float

# Variable Naming Rules:
# Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
# Variable names must start with a letter or underscore.
# Variable names are case-sensitive.
# Avoid using Python keywords as variable names (e.g., print, if, else).

# Best Practices:
# Use descriptive names that reflect the purpose of the variable.
# Use lowercase letters for variable names.
# Separate words using underscores for readability (e.g., first_name, total_amount).
# 34age=4 #Invalid variable name (start with a number)
age=32 #valid variable name because it start with a letter
_age=40#valid variable name because it start with a underscore
a_b_=50#valid variable name because it contain letters and underscores
