# Types of Operators:

# 1.Arithmetic Operators:

# + (Addition), - (Subtraction), * (Multiplication), / (Division), % (Modulus), ** (Exponentiation), // (Floor Division).
print(10 + 5)   # Output: 15
print(10 ** 2)  # Output: 100

# 2.Comparison Operators:

# == (Equal), != (Not Equal), > (Greater Than), < (Less Than), >= (Greater Than or Equal), <= (Less Than or Equal).
print(10 > 5)   # Output: True
print(10 == 5)  # Output: False

# 3.Logical Operators:

# and, or, not.
print(True and False)  # Output: False
print(True or False)   # Output: True
print(not True)        # Output: False

# 4.Assignment Operators:

# =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=.
x = 10
x += 5  # Equivalent to x = x + 5
print(x)  # Output: 15

# 5.Membership Operators:

# in, not in.
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print("banana" in fruits)  # Output: True


# 6.Identity Operators:

# is, is not.
x = 10
y = 10
print(x is y)  # Output: True
print(x is not y)  # Output: False

# Summary:

# Variables store data, and Python supports multiple data types.
# Typecasting allows you to convert between data types.
# Use input() to take user input and print() to display output.
# Comments and escape sequences help make your code more readable.
# Python provides a variety of operators for performing operations on data.
